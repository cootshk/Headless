# Headless

Eliminating someone gives you their head.
You can use the head to revive them, or use it as a strength bonus

## Installation

Headless requires Minecraft 1.20.2+

Older versions **will not** be supported, as they are missing the macro functions feature.

This datapack was tested on 1.20.4 (newest version at the time of release), but should theoretically support 1.20.2 and 1.20.3.

Place the `.zip` file from Modrinth or GitHub Releases into your `world/datapacks` folder to install the datapack. After you have moved the file, either restart the server or run `/reload`.

## Usage

Getting a kill will automatically grant you the *Got a kill!* advancement.

Getting two kills will restore one of your lives. 

Dying to a player will make you lose a life. 

If you manage to eliminate a player, then they will be forced into spectator mode, you will be rewarded a player head that makes you stronger, and you will earn the *Elimination* advancement.

You can also craft a new life, using this recipe:

# Debug functions

These functions will only run as SaltyHxH or Cootshk, and require server function permission level to be 4.
There should be no reason to use these functions during gameplay.

Enable using `/scoreboard players set Debug headless_Settings 1`, and disable using `/scoreboard players set Debug headless_Settings 0`
